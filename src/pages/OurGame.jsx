          As any other visual novel, our game mainly focuses on a story and
          dialogues. As the story progresses, a player gets tested on a variety
          of Japanglish words that naturally appear in a conversation. The
          happiness metre shows how successful you are at guessing their
          meanings. Should the hearts drop to zero, it's a game over and you
          have to start again. The game has several locations, each consisting
          of a unique set of test vocabulary connected to a certain place such
          as a train station, school, caf√©, restaurant, shopping centre and
          home.
